<h3>What type of grip I should use for My Racket? </h3>
<br>
<div class = "ContainerForGrips">
    <div class = "leadContent1"> Tacky Grip 
        <h6>Characteristics: Tacky grips provide a sticky feel, enhancing the player's ability to hold the racket firmly.</h6>
        <h6>When to Use: Tacky grips are beneficial in situations where players might sweat a lot or in humid conditions. They help prevent the racket from slipping during play.</h6>
    </div>
    <div class = "leadContent1"> Absorbent Grip 
        <h6>Characteristics: Absorbent grips are designed to soak up moisture, such as sweat, keeping the grip dry and comfortable.</h6>
        <h6>When to Use: Absorbent grips are ideal for players who tend to sweat heavily. They provide a dry surface to maintain a solid grip, even in hot and humid weather.</h6>
    </div>
    <div class = "leadContent1"> Leather Grip 
        <h6>Characteristics: Leather grips provide a classic, firm feel and can absorb sweat to some extent.</h6>
        <h6>When to Use: Some players prefer the traditional and natural feel of leather grips. They can be suitable for players who don't sweat excessively and appreciate a more solid grip.</h6>
    </div>
</div>
<!-- divided the containers here so there is a more pleasing User Interface-->
<div class = "ContainerForGrips">
    <div class = "leadContent1"> Cushioned Grip 
        <h6>Characteristics: Cushioned grips have additional padding for extra comfort and shock absorption.</h6>
        <h6>When to Use: Cushioned grips are suitable for players who experience discomfort or vibration in their hands during play. They help reduce the impact on the hands and wrists.</h6>
    </div>
    <div class = "leadContent1"> Replacement Grip 
        <h6>Characteristics: Replacement grips are the primary grips that come with the racket. They vary in material and thickness.</h6>
        <h6>When to Use: Replacement grips are suitable for players who like the feel that came with their racket. They may need replacement when they wear out or if a player wants to try a different type.</h6>
    </div>
    <div class = "leadContent1">  Overgrip 
        <h6>Characteristics: Overgrips are thinner grips that players can wrap over their existing grips to customize feel and absorbency.</h6>
        <h6>When to Use: Overgrips are versatile and allow players to experiment with different textures, tackiness, or thickness without changing the base grip. They are often used to refresh the grip or adapt to changing weather conditions.</h6>
